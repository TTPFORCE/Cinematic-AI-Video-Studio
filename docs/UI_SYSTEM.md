# UI System

## Philosophy
The UI is designed as a cinematic control surface, not a traditional editor.
Every interaction should feel deliberate, premium, and responsive.

## Core UI Areas
- Timeline (multi-track, cinematic-focused)
- Viewer (real-time playback & preview)
- Inspector (context-aware controls)
- Asset Browser (local-first media management)

## Interaction Model
- Drag-based timeline editing
- Keyframe animation handles
- Snap & magnet controls
- Gesture-friendly (mouse, touch, stylus)

## Upgrade-Based UI Locks
- Advanced color grading panels
- AI-assisted editing tools
- Batch operations & macros
- Premium transitions & effects

Locked UI elements are visible but disabled, reinforcing value without blocking flow.

## Performance
- GPU-accelerated UI rendering
- Low-latency input handling
- Offline-safe UI state caching

## Visual Style
- Dark cinematic theme
- Minimal chrome
- Focus-driven layout
- Subtle motion & micro-animations
